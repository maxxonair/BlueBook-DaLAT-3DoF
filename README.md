15/09/2019

- 3 degree of freedom and 6 degree of freedom vehicle dynamics simulation, designed for various analyses between orbit and surface with respect to a variety of planetary bodies, with and without atmoshpere. 
- Customizable to various problems (very simple to very complex), e.g re-entry trajectories, landing trajectories, ascent trajectories, atmospheric flight, controlled landing, system failure analysis ... 
- Integrated controller setup to simulate simplified control strategies.
- Integrated gravity model (asymmetric gravity, rotating planet)
- Integrated atmosphere model (free molecular flow and continuum model)
- Integrated system error model to simulate partial subsystem failure(s) and analyse system robustness.# BlueBook Descent and Landing Analysis Toolkit
